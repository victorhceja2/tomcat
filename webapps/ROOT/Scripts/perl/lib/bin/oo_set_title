=head1	NAME

oo_set_title - Set the title of a document using

=head1	USAGE

oo_set_title <filename> <new title>

=head1	SYNOPSIS

This sample script outputs the current title of an ODF file, then it replaces
it using a command line argument as the new title. If the command line doesn't
provide a new title, then the program uses the first heading text in the
document body. If the document doesn't contain any heading element, nothing
is changed.
